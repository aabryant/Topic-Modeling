# Topic-Modeling
This repository contains scripts for working with the We the People petition data using LDA topic modeling and LDAvis for visualization. The majority of the work is reflected in a publication "Open Data Visualizations and Analytics as Tools for Policy-Making" accepted for publication by Government Information Quarterly.
